# quartoWBtheme

A World Bank theme for Quarto Reveal.js Presentations. **Why Quarto?** Because
it is a cross-language publishing platform that will allow you to create
beautiful HTML presentations with your R or Python code on short notice!
This theme's goal is to allow researchers at the Bank to focus on the content
rather than the form of their presentations by providing a range of sensible
defaults, from the implementation of the official color palette to the inclusion
of a World Bank themed ggplot theme.

See a demo [here]().

# quartoWBtheme

A World Bank theme for Quarto Reveal.js Presentations. **Why Quarto?** Because
it is a cross-language publishing platform that will allow you to create
beautiful HTML presentations with your R or Python code on short notice!
This theme's goal is to allow researchers at the Bank to focus on the content
rather than the form of their presentations by providing a range of sensible
defaults, from the implementation of the official color palette to the inclusion
of a World Bank themed ggplot theme.

See a demo [here]().

## Using this theme:

To use this presentation theme, create a project folder, open a console in that
folder, and run the following command:

```
quarto use template BBieri/quartoWBtheme
```

This will copy all required stylesheets and templates to your project folder
of the latest version of the template. You can then remove files that you don't
need and edit the `.qmd` presentation.

## Building the presentation:

To build the presentation, simply run `quarto render template.qmd` from the
same console or open up the `template.qmd` file and hit `CTRL/CMD + K` depending
on your OS.
